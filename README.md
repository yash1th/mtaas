Mobile Testing as a Service Using Cloud
- The main purpose of the project is to provide mobile emulators in cloud to perform testing for users.
- Infrastructure is setup using Amazon EC2 on which the emulators run. 
- A user can provision multiple emulators in the cloud on demand and get access to those emulators for testing.
- A billing module tracks the usage of these emulators on the basis of time for which they are running and charges users accordingly
